      <p><span class="lettrine">A</span>n <strong>I</strong>nput <strong>M</strong>ethod <strong>E</strong>ditor, a program that enables the input of characters not natively supported on the input devices, typically be using a sequence of characters that <em>are</em> natively available. Languages that utilise NON XXX writing systems such as Mandarin, Japanese, Korean require this to feasible enter characters without having a hundred+ key keyboard. This is how however found for more than just language input, possibly for the input of diacritics, a unicode character (by code) and evening Latin characters sometimes.</p>
<p>Naturally, wayland being very new and niche, support for such a program is not widespread. Even at the point of this being written, there is no way to introduce a 3rd party window for further character selection (which is considered as standard functionality). It was for this reason that I was motivated to create my own completely from scratch.</p>
<h2>The Nitty Gritty of Development</h2>
<p><span class="lettrine">G</span>etting started was not an easy task, first of all I had no idea how input methods worked, and at the conceiving of this project I was still using Xorg, which was actual living hell for IME developers (more on that later). I started off trying to reverse engineer fcitx5, the up &amp; coming standard in the IME world on Linux. Although it is very well organised the fact I am not a C++ developer &amp; the amount of extraness required for Xorg support was <em>extremely</em> confusing. I was not quite sure what I was doing but I luckily stumbled upon the OpenBangla project which was also made in Rust. This allowed me to narrow it down to a simple application that will take an input (i.e. key) and output the desired key after some black magic, i.e. the engine. Not terribly complex and I managed to get a working version quite easily, but now how do I get this to actually take in the keyboards input on the fly? </p>
<p>    I originally tried creating an fcitx5 module, the project is great but I just could not wrap my head around all these makefiles and c interop, to say the least it was a hot dumpster fire. I managed to get it working while sacrificing a lot of things on the way there but, it was working (thank you OpenBangla). It was at this time I coincidentelly moved over to wayland which just broke all my hard work, I realised at this moment what a fucking mess Xorg really is. I spent hours and hours scouring the internet looking for ways to get it working on wayland, but alas nothing. That is, until I found the KIME project, a hangeul IME made in Rust supporting wayland as a first-class citizen. I couldn't believe it, the gods blessed me and showed me a project properly implemented the not-veryknown wayland protocol zwp_input_method_v2-unstable. All I had to do was create a wayland client implementing the aforementioned protocol and hook it up with the engine that outputs the desired character·s based on the input! Sounds simple enough right? Well it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows and unsurprisingly implemented a wayland client is not so straightforward. I might've heavily based my wayland client on that of KIMEs but hey, that's the point of open source right, sharing knowledge n' all that jazz.</p>
<p>    I would just like to say how much wayland simplified the process, on Xorg one would need to implement a client for all the main gui toolkits as this was handled on the application level. It wouldn't even work with applications that decide to implement their own window management such as rofi. It still does not work for rofi but that is only due to the fact rofi does not have full wayland support yet, even though efforts from the community (thanks lbonnn) are being done.</p>
<h2>Benten</h2>
<p><span class="lettrine">A</span>s per the <code>README.md</code> benten is &quot;A flexible input method engine made and tested only for unix systems&quot;. You may ask though, what makes this so special? There's a plethora of shabby input method engines out there that all do the same thing. Let's continue reading: &quot;which allows the easy configuration of mixed-script writing systems such as Kana/Kanji &amp; Hangul/Hanja.&quot; Ah, there it is, interesting. So one might ask, what does that even mean? Fair question, I'll explain: Have you ever thought, wow, is there truly no touch-typing friendly way to type the languages which utilise chinese characters? Well luckily there is! Shape-based IMEs are a whole world of their own but they do exist, although they're not as popular as their phonetic counterparts. The basis of such as IME the input sequence is based on the shape of the character, rather than its pronunciation. This allows characters to be written across different languages &amp; dialects all in retaining the ability of touch typing! </p>
<p>    The problem is, what about mixed scripts? Many IMEs implementing shape-based methods exist, but none for writing systems which make use of both chinese characters and another script. Here comes in Benten, the IME allowing fluid changing between methods. The prime example is that of Japanese, utilising three scripts makes it incredibly hard to design a method for this, epecially one that does not depend on phonetics. There weren't many options, to change between katakana and hiragana was straightforward, the kana key which changes between the two respective layouts is likely the best solution. However, what do you do to input Kanji? As the only way of touch-typing chinese characters is by using a shape-based IME, I had to somehow cram one in this layout. What makes Benten unique is its first-class support for a shape based IME around a traditional keyboard layout. Once a specific key is pressed (in my case I use the equivalent of ; on a standard US keyboard), it will swap into Kanji mod, under the hood I am using the Cangjie5 dictionary (however any dictionary can be used).</p>
<p>Some examples thus far:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Japanese</th><th>Benten (Total Keystrokes)</th><th>Romaji (Total Keystrokes)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>有り難う</td><td>;kb 7;toog j (12)</td><td>arigatou (8)</td></tr>

    As you can see it is comparable to the phonetic japanese keyboard in key strokes, however one is able to touch type and the other not, which in my eyes is a win. And yes, this could've been made with a script but where's the fun in such a Frankenstein, not to mention the lack of fine grained control?</p>
<h2>Ankra</h2>
<p><span class="lettrine">A</span>nkra, I suppose a fork of benten exclusively implementing the table method. Frankly, benten may not have been the best of ideas, nor of executions either, it was however a great learning experience. It was my 2nd project in Rust, and realistically my first completed real project.</p>
<p>Ankra was the project I was admittely losing hope for. I ended up trying <code>RIME</code>s cangjie, which is great but very bloaty and confusing to configure, not to mention all the docs I could find where in Mandarin. What separates RIMEs cangjie to mine is the QoL features that making typing a smooth experience.  such as phrase support, a &quot;smart&quot; dictionary, inputting multiple characters without needing to <em>space bar</em> each one in. </p>
