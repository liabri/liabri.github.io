("Shifts through a lens", 2023-03-22, [rumination, photography], fr-FR)

<span class="lettrine">P</span>hotography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. Used for many purposes, spanning from scientific to manufacturing to business; it is however rather of interest to me in thanks to it's artistic application above all.

    It's not as if I never enjoyed taking photos and capturing moments, but it was, and still is in many ways, something that has always taken a backseat. I first started using my mum's Nikon D530, a digital camera; yet I didn't particularly enjoy it too much, it had this obscure bland feeling. However, and this might be silly, that has changed in more than a few ways since I discovered analogue photography. I met ShiLong a year and a half ago now, finding out he was into analogue photography quite early on in our relationship. It had instantly piqued my interest, however nothing happened out of it until the day my mum found a multitude of older cameras at my grandmas. I took up the Halina Paulette to Toulouse, a very cheap and rubbish camera from the 1980s. I asked ShiLong to help me understand how to use it, he taught me everything I know right now. After lots of fumbling around, we managed to get the jank working and went exploring and shooting photos for the first time around Toulouse; I used the whole 36 photo roll in one day. Suffice to say I very much enjoyed myself. I won't overplay analogue photography as from a purely functional point of view it's most definitely inferior. However, decisions are not solely based on function, but also these silly emotions. At this point it'd be safe to say that analogue photography had taken a good grip on my heart.

    What makes analogue photography so great? you may ask. It's a plethora of things that are very hard to put into words, but I'll try. For starters, scarcity, in economic terms this phonemenon refers to the basic fact of life that there exists only a finite amount resources. Of course the physical finite amount of resources to take photos is effectively infinite in the context of humans, but that's not what I mean. For me, analogue photography is by definition finite. The process being a lot more complex to capture images than that of digital photography; every photo is worth so much more. The expenses involved both financial and temporal impose a limit of time and money one can pour into it, inherently defining a tangeable limit of photos; or rather finiteness so to speak. I like to call this concept « relative scarcity »: having too little means so much.

    The word « photography » introduces another concept: etymologically composed from the Greek roots φωτός (phōtós), the genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light" and γραφή (graphé) "representation by means of lines" or "drawing"; together meaning "drawing with light". In analogue photography, photos are captured by exposing the film to the light, the film's specific chemical composition reacting to the light. One might say the light is drawing itself onto the film as if it were a canvas. Digital photography, for sake of this analogy, relies on a digital canvas that converts the information from light waves to signals. This might not matter to others, but it's as if analogue photography results in the original canvas of the artist, sharing a historical presence with it the light, the painter; whilst digital photography is merely unoriginals, covers of the original. This sense of originality unreasonably resonates with me, I cannot explain why, sometimes I wish it wasn't so significant, but it is.

    Functionally lastly, but not realistically: everybody seems to know that feeling of adventure that photography enables, whenever mentioned, everyone agrees. Yet, it's eluded me until very recently when I picked up my very own camera. I don't really think everyone's experienced it, rather everyone just knows of it. I am very comfortable with myself and being alone, but for some reason I tend to take less risks when alone compared to when I'm with someone else; « risk » being used very liberally here. It's very much something I still have to ponder on, but the presence of another person just induces the desire to explore. I've been aware of this since my first gap year after 6th form, thinking particularly of a specific introspective moment I had while exploring in Germany:

    *February 2020, Düsseldorf, Germany.* Just before covid really struck, I had visited my good friend Jonas for a month, staying with him, his girlfriend, daughter, unbeloved cat Nico and beloved good boy Ohnezan. My first trip alone, meeting Jonas for the first time. There were limited things to do as an awkward teen, one of these things being hiking. One day in particular however, whilst exploring his town and surroundings to the fullest, I had found myself quite far with a decision to make: two paths, one through the woods; the other continuing into the open meadows. The former was rougher, darker, rather scarier; the latter was open and idyllic. Without having further athink, I continued following my original pastoral path, however something was irking me; I paused, and the idea of following the other path was glooming on me. I'm not particularly sure what it was, but I noticed that were I not alone, I would've have definitely tried my upmost to convince the other·s to be more adventurous. Soon after, I realised the situation I had found myself in was rather: Am I going to continue being alone when alone? At this point in my life, I remember mentioning to my friend Hanka that I was wanting to try and become more adventurous on my own, more like the person I am when with others. This being a big time in my life provoking a lot of change, I went for it, I followed the forlorn path.

    A camera will bring in an aspect of motivation to go places I wouldn't normally go, often that would imply trickier paths, paths I would never follow at my own volition, without the goal of a great shot at least. In some ways, a camera is a friend; I'm no longer alone.
