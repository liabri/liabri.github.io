("L’origine de soi-même", 2022-04-23, [raison-d’être], en-US)

<span class="lettrine">W</span>ell, as of late I've been wanting to start a more long term project to organise all my thoughts & projects, and recently I've stumbled upon a bunch of personal websites (mostly consisting of blogs and development projects) which inspired me to make my own. The thing is, a website requires content, but what was I to upload? One of my first ideas was a blog, but what about? I noticed that I often go off on tangents and rants about unrelated topics, often including my friends and thought that a blog would be a great place to release these interesting \**insert an adjective I cannot think of*\* adventures. Whence the birth of this blog! It may seem as though the site is solely comprised of this blog, but I assure you I have a lot more other things & sub-sites if you will planned to be hosted on this domain!\
