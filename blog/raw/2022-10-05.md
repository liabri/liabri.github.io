("Naming Myself", 2022-10-05, [language, mandarin, japanese], en-US)

<span class="lettrine">I</span>'ve been learning chinese mandarin for a few months now and my friend 世龙 asked me what my chinese name was, I told him that I don't have one (yet). So he decided to help me name myself! Which by the way, is a very weird thing to do in my experience. Looking at you Ying Fu Ping.

## Attempt n°1
<span class="lettrine">S</span>o first comes first is `lian`, a very straightforward transformation based on my actual name `Liam`; just stuffed into one syllable with a slight nasal change from an [m] to an [n]. However the tricky part is the tone & character to convey it. 世龙 said the second tone (́ ́) just sounds right for this, and I'm too much of a noob to understand and/or contest it so I went with it. Apparently it is a semi rare unisex name, 连 often used for males and 连 for females, however I am one to overcomplicate things and as my name is meant to represent me, I want to show case that trait. I've found the following characters:

聯: closely related to 连 to the point they are synonymous in Japanese, I'm not too keen on the meaning though.\
練: a surname, white silk literarally speaking but most commonly "to practice"; again, not what I'm looking for.\
鏈: chain, clearly incorporating 连 for it's phonetic property, not bad but I'm not too sure how nice this sounds in chinese\
廉: honest; incorruptible; honourable: now this has got quite a nice meaning and is very visually pleasing, for now I'll stick with this, but nothing is set in stone!

    This was tricky, names in Chinese (at least standard Mandarin) often need to be disyllabic (not always) and so lián risks sounding strange on it's own. As a solution I will be adding a secondary syllable to my name, which is a lot tougher than it sounds. This extra syllable could be found before or after, but for some reason I personally would find this "extra" syllable to be quite cumbersome if placed before my actual transliterated name: Liàn, so I'll be putting it after. Along with 世龙 I brainstormed as he sits in the boot of his car as if from a 90s film, we do a X of 2 things:

1. Translate the meaning of my name Liam to chinese, which can be traced back to Wilhelm meaning "determined protector", leading to the name 連戰 `lián zhàn`. However, not only am I not a big fan of the `zhàn` sound but it also the name of a famous Taiwanese President from roughly 25 years ago, I'm not sure what it is but I'd rather not have my name be associated with famous political figures, especially considering the tensions regarding Taiwan.
	
2. Search up a list of chinese names starting with `lián`, a lot of nice ones were read, most notably *zhao xiao ....*, but I ended up going with `hui`, not sure what it is but it just felt right.

    Now it's time to choose the tone and find the appropriate character, I was always leaning towards the first or fourth tone, and fortunately those 2 are the richest lexicologically speaking. The following is a non-exhaustive list of characters with the `hui` reading (I'm sure there are many many more but I would like to keep it more or less intelligible to the majority of the population).


| Tone | Characters   					|
|------|--------------------------------|
|  ¯   | 诙麾徽暉輝隳揮恢         			|
|  ´   | 洄蛔茴回                			|
|  ˇ   | 虺咴誨                  		|
|  `   | 会蟪恚彗喙穢蕙諱薈慧繪繢卉惠彙賄晦燴	|


    I ended up going with 輝 as 連輝 is an actual name, not too common but it exists! Reading of `huī` meaning `brightness; lustre; brilliance; radiance; splendour` as per Wiktionary. I was unable to find a surname, 小島 was of interest as it means `little island` (i.e. what I'm from), but it is chiefly Japanese and would sound strange to many Chinese.

## Attempt n°2
<span class="lettrine">W</span>ell, after literal months trying to warm up to 廉輝, I just couldn't. Not only do I struggle to write the 3rd stroke (INSERT NAME) because I'm left handed, I just really don't like the key XX. I asked for some help online, where I met Arthur (XX). After going back and fourth with him I decided I wasn't too fond of `lian` either, it was a mouthful to say especially for my western friends. In addition, Arthur told me it really is okay to have a single syllable given name, his being like that; even though it is a lot less common (at roughly 8% of the chinese population at time of writing). This led me to choosing a name that is both more faithful to what my mother wanted when naming me Liam (i.e. a short name that is easy to say) and something I can identify with more: `li`. Expectedly, many people call me `Lee` rather than `Liam`, so you could say that `li` is more fidele to my western name than `lian` is. 

    This is where I make my life miserably hard, I'd like a name that easily translated to Japanese, I plan on integrating into Japanese culture one day, and, in my opinion, having the same written name in both Chinese and Japanese would be a big plus. I already struggle at the prospect of having two names (and therefore identities), to the point I cannot even begin to fathom having three! A big criteria though was, I'd like my Japanese name to use native Japanese readings (Kun'yomi), as it is closer to the roots of the Japanese. This led me on a search for chinese characters that are used in both Chinese and Japanese, with the Japanese variant having native readings for given names (Nanori). The two I found that had a `li` reading in chinese were 鯉 and 禮. CARP introduced many given names that I really liked such as 鯉次郎(こいじろう/Koijirou​), 鯉子山(こいごやま/Koigoyama​) or 鯉之輔(こいのすけ/Koinosuke), however as you can see they all require supplementary characters to complete the name. This implies that my name would not be 1:1 from Chinese to Japanese. However, lo' and behold 禮 (or shinjitai 礼), which do indeed have many readings without introducing any other characters, this exhaustively includes: ​ゆたか/Yutaka​, ひろ/Hiro, ひろし/Hiroshi and ゆずる/Yuzuru. Originally I did not appreciate ​ゆたか much, but it is somewhat growing on me, I have yet to decide which Japanese reading I will go for though.

    Now that I've found a very solid given name, I must find a surname; something I am still going back and fourth with at time of writing. Chinese are quite particular about surname, contrary to given name, you cannot choose whatever character or reading you like; it must be attested, and the rarer it is the more odd it may appear. Originally, I was thinking of going for something that starts with b to retain my initials L.B. in Mandarin, the only surname really satisfying this was 白 bai2, which is surname no. 55 according to the 100SURNAMELISTPOEM. This surname translates quite well into Japanese too allowing names such as しらざきShirazaki, しらはまShirahama and しらやぎShirayagi, which in all honestly I'm quite fond of. However, as I am a long practicioner of masochism, I decided that 白禮 was not visually satisfying enough. The character 白 is composed of two horizontal keys (with 日 taking up the vast majority of the area), whilst 禮 of two vertical keys. This made me doubt if I'd even like 白禮 phonetically, bai2li3, not bad; but what about zhong2li3? or potentially chun2li3?

Hello ! I am sorry for not having responded for so long, once I got back from my trip I had to quickly come back to France for university and my discord correspondents where the last thing on my mind honestly with all the stress and exams 😅 It is understandable if you do not want to continue, but I would like to :) I am going back to my home country Malta tomorrow, currently it is 3AM nearly and I am searching for my Japanese name, lol. 

I started working on chinese this semestre of university, where my name is "白禮", which I've purposefully chosen because I know it is very easy to make Japanese native like しらざき · ゆたか; but I am still deciding the exact way to pronounce it :). Do you think you could help me? Otherwise, I haven't worked a lot on my Japanese but I would like to get into the rhythm again.




### Progress
Just a random note on my progress in chinese as I don't want to make blog posts dedicated to it too often.

This is what im able to reproduced on my own:4
我好饿。
我草你妈的。
我想死。
他爸爸忙吗？
你好吗？
我也忙。
你饿吗？
我的妹妹想成为马耳他人。

This is what I learnt while writing the ones above:

不工作
今天世龙不草吗？
悲伤的很消息
他的手是他的女朋友。


>M'għandi l-ebda idea x'qed nagħmlu bħalissa, kull ma rrid nagħmel insib l-isem ċiniż tiegħi. Għalissa għandi jew `feng lian` jew `xia lian`, jogħġobni ħafna l-ħoss `f` imma ma tantx hawn sillabbi li joqgħodu tajjeb ma' `lian`. pereżempju `fen lian` jfisser `ħara liam`. Suppost l-isem tiegħi jiġi tradutt bħala `lian mu` imma vera ma jogħġobnix il `mu` u ShiLong qal li mhux problema biex ineħħih fortunatament.\
