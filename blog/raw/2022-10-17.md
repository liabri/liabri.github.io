《施氏食狮史》\
石室诗士施氏，嗜狮，誓食十狮。\
氏时时适市视狮。\
十时，适十狮适市。\
是时，适施氏适市。\
氏视是十狮，恃矢势，使是十狮逝世。\
氏拾是十狮尸，适石室。\
石室湿，氏**使侍拭**石室。\
石室拭，氏始试食是十狮。\
食时，始识是十狮尸，实十石狮尸。\

试释是事。

<p style="text-align: center;">« The Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den »<br/>
In a stone den was a poet called Shi Shi, who was a lion addict and had resolved to eat ten lions.<br/>
He often went to the market to look for lions.<br/>
At ten o’clock, ten lions had just arrived at the market.<br/>
At that time, Shi had just arrived at the market.<br/>
He saw those ten lions and, using his trusty arrows, caused the ten lions to die.<br/>
He brought the corpses of the ten lions to the stone den.<br/>
The stone den was damp. So he asked his servants to wipe it.<br/>
After wiping the stone den, he tried to eat those ten lions.<br/>
When he ate, he realized that these ten lions were, in fact, ten stone lion corpses.</p>

The poem was written in the 1930s by the Chinese linguist [趙元任]^Zhào.Yuánrèn^ as a linguistic demonstration. As this poem is written in Classical Chinese, many words are composed of single characters rather than the double characters that are more commonly found in modern Chinese.

 
**Traduttore, traditore**
The cultural interchange spawned the Italian phrase, Traduttore, traditore: Translator, traitor. First applied to the French by irate Italians who felt that many French-language translations of Dante betrayed either the beauty or the accuracy of the work, this clever consonance plays upon the worst fears of an international society.

The Italians and the French have a history of cultural rivalry that dates back to before the Renaissance, when scholars, philosophers, artists, and writers of the two countries held the reins of Europe. Fostering progress in tandem, European polyglots and translators found themselves translating the works of their neighbors.

The cultural interchange spawned the Italian phrase, Traduttore, traditore: Translator, traitor. First applied to the French by irate Italians who felt that many French-language translations of Dante betrayed either the beauty or the accuracy of the work, this clever consonance plays upon the worst fears of an international society.

Is it possible to remain entirely faithful to the text one translates? And are there words, phrases, and entire ideas that simply escape translation?

The notion of translator as traitor deals with what in ethnological linguistics is called a lexical gap, or lacuna. A lacuna, from the Latin meaning a hole or ditch, refers to the absence of a word or idiomatic phrase in translation from one language to another. Puns that rely on wordplay – spoonerisms and palindromes – grammatical and syntactical variations, and objects, actions, or ideas that do not exist in a culture or language constitute several types of lacunas that pose problems to translators. How does one translate the title – and all corresponding names and events – of Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest? Several French translations exist that capitalize on first names like Fidèle and Constant, both of which also carry with them an emotional weight – that of fidelity. But certainly fidelity and earnestness are different concepts, and even though the double-entendre is preserved, the meaning is altered.

But translation is not a new field, and over the centuries, professional translators have developed many techniques to circumvent becoming a translator-traitor. Here are just a few:

Adaptation, or “free translation”, is a process in which the translator replaces a word, phrase, or concept for one that corresponds with it in the target language.

Borrowing is the literal and direct usage of a foreign word, usually printed in italics.

Compensation is the replacement of culturally- or linguistically-untranslatable terms for approximations in the target language, created by altering grammar, syntax, or tone.

Periphrasis is the most indirect process of translation, requiring the translator to replace words or expressions for terms that exist in the target language.


咏鹅
鹅，鹅，鹅，
曲项向天歌。
白毛浮绿水，
红掌拨清波

長恨歌\
第一段：貴妃受寵\
漢皇重色思傾國，御宇多年求不得。楊家有女初長成，養在深閨人未識。
天生麗質難自棄，一朝選在君王側。回眸一笑百媚生，六宮粉黛無顏色。
春寒賜浴華清池，溫泉水滑洗凝脂。侍兒扶起嬌無力，始是新承恩澤時。
雲鬢花顏金步搖，芙蓉帳暖度春宵。春宵苦短日高起，從此君王不早朝。
承歡侍宴無閒暇，春從春遊夜專夜。後宮佳麗三千人，三千寵愛在一身。
金屋妝成嬌侍夜，玉樓宴罷醉和春。姊妹弟兄皆列土，可憐光彩生門戶。
遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女。驪宮高處入青雲，仙樂風飄處處聞。
緩歌慢舞凝絲竹，盡日君王看不足。漁陽鼙鼓動地來，驚破霓裳羽衣曲

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
He chortled in his joy.

Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
