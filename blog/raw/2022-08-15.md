("Designing a Solar System", 2022-08-15, [world-building], en-US)

<span class="lettrine">W</span>orld building, what I'd like to define as an infinitely deep rabbit hole one may find themselves stuck in. Fortunately I have not delved too deep into it *yet*, however my future is indeed looking bleek. Do note that all the names present are anglicised loan words from the Fluvian language, the lingua franca of the X sea; considered to be the most influential language in Ester (I might've jumped the gun and started working on some conlangs in the world).

The motivation behind this was.....

## The Realism Conundrum
<span class="lettrine">A</span> very tricky part of this whole project is deciding what degree of realism I desire, for obvious reasons it will never be *real*, and I will always need to bend some rules pertaining to our reality. I would like to however make it plausible, in that your average Joe wouldn't really be able to tell what's right from what makes absolutely no sense, physically speaking. Anyway, I wouldn't even be able to appreciate a world which has no sound logic or science baked into its existence; which is why I will be simulating the entire solar system in the "game" University Sandbox 2, just to get all the numbers correct and properly visualise the ol' great Basterous.

## The Basterous
<span class="lettrine">T</span>he Basterous, the solar system our world finds itself in. I think it is only natural to start off by designing the solar system. Unsurprisingly, I'll be starting with the sun found at the heart of the system; it's likely to be a single sun system, I am not however against the idea of introducing a second sun with a *very* large orbit, causing it to having near negligible effects. I'll have to see how feasible that is once I've got a more solid foundation set. 

Etymology...

More about planets, where the solar system is found, info about it.

The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[e] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[11] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula,[12] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[11] As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion km; 19 billion mi)[11] and a hot, dense protostar at the centre.[13][14] The planets formed by accretion from this disc,[15] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.[16][17]

### Ester (Planet #4, ours.)

<span class="lettrine">E</span>ster (/ɛstɛr/), likely the only habitable planet of the solar system. As mentioned in the introduction, the name « Ester » is an anglicised version of the Fluvian word « ᛁᛋᛏᛁᛦ » written in the Younger Futhark alphabet. The etymology of the aforementioned word is quite straightforward, « ᛁᛋ » is considered an honourific particle found at the beginning of words, whilst « ᛏᛁᛦ » is a contraction of « ᛏᛁᚱᛋᚴᛁᚾ » (Terskin), meaning rock. You may translate it roughly to "Ô Rock", employing the English vocative as the closest translation possible for the honourific particle « ᛁᛋ ».

    Now was the time to start crunching some numbers, a planet of Earth's size would be very hard to manage on my own, so I elected to go for one a bit smaller, more precisely 85% of Earth's circumference and radius, a decision which led to having a surface area 73% that of Earth's, which I believe to be a suitable size. Naturally, I had to increase the density of the planet to make up for the smaller size, or else our inhabitants would be struggling to keep to the ground. With a density of 129% that of Earth's, we were able to achieve a similar gravity of 109%. All this information with the precise numbers is found in the table below.

The obliquity will influence a lot, such as the...

    The first decision to be made is regarding the planets orbit was its position relative to the sun, naturally I will be aiming to put it in the solar systems habitable zone. I ultimately went for a semi-major axis (a) of 1.43 AU away from the sun as it is the closest possible distance considering the periapsis of the planet's orbit. This distance was chosen mainly due to the fact that I'd like to minimise the length of a solar year as it is already looking to be more than 500 days long!

    Now that the planets physical properties have been decided, along with its position relative to the sun, we can start designing its orbit and some of its implications. I won't go into detail about every number and variable I worked on as it was essentially just a process of tweaking some numbers in a calculator to achieve a temperature and solar year length that I felt was suitable. I will likely revisit these numbers when I start working on the climates and weather patterns to better balance them.

At this point we need to calculate the albedo (A), which is a way to quantify how much solar radiation is refelected off Earth and back into space. This is measured from a scale of 0-1, 0 corresponding to a black body absorbing all radiation, and 1 corresponding to a body that reflects all radiation. Naturally, the more that is reflected, the lower the planets temperature. To calculate the albedo we must know the composition of Estra, meaning the amount of open water, snow, ice, rock, forest and so on. Expectedly, this has not yet been decided, however I can give a rough guess on what I am expecting to do, I will then come back and tweak these numbers once it's all decided in the future.

This amount to a clear sky albedo of 0.14. However, clouds also contribute significantly to a planets albedo, with a standard albedo of 0.55. Therefore, considering roughly 60% of Ester's surface is covered by clouds at any given moment, the clouds contribute 60% of 0.55 albedo, that being 0.33. The remainder 40% of the surface is clear skies, contributing 40% of 0.14 albedo, which is 0.05. The total albedo of the planet is therefore the summation of 0.33 and 0.05, that is A = 0.38.

As a product of all the previous calculations, we are now able now deduce the following:

The temperature was calculated using the following equation: ((L~♁~(1-A)) / (16πσa^2^))^1/4^ where L~♁~=L~☉~(3.839(10^26^)). This however returns 246 K (-27°C), which is well below the temperature of a habitable planet; Thankfully, as a remedy, other factors such as the greenhouse effect warm up the planet by 31 K (41°C), giving Ester an average temperature of 277 K (14°C).

#### Moon(s?)
Well, now that the basis for the planet is more or less done it's time to decide what moons will orbit it. Moons have a very large influence on our planet, not only are they used to tell the time using lunar calendars but they also dictate the wind, tide, and probably a lot more things I'm not qualified to know; essentially the world would not be the way we all have come to love it if not for that pesky moon. I'd like to have more than one moon, not only would it be more interesting from cultural perspective, but based on the wise words of a reddit nomad, three moons is concievable and not too complicated, so I'll be striving for that.

##### Aetiola /aɪtioʊlɑ/
The largest of the three moons, illuminating the night sky with a deep red colour.

##### Persys /pɛɹsɪs/
The smallest & closest of the three moons, composed of *IRON?* giving it a dark appearance filling the days sky with a very constrasting object, light does not reflect particularly well off it making it disappear at night.

##### Dioxst /daɪokst/
The middle child, although not much smaller than Aetiola, it is the furthest of the three moons giving it a similar size to Persys from the perspective of the planet.


#### Ring?

Rings sometimes have big bursts of entries into earths atmosphere but burn up before hitting the ground, cool for culture imagine lots of things coming down to earth than vanishing before they hit, buncha sewed freaking out.
