        <p><span class="lettrine">A</span>lbi is a commune in the south of France, a mere 85km north of Toulouse. Naturally, living in Toulouse, Albi was a destination on the list to check and boy did it provoke some thought. I had gone with Charlotte, her mother, sister and weird little cousin who very much reminded me of Druxu due to her mannerisms. I've been to many different cities in and around France, and none of them have ever inspired me to write anything, but Albi is somewhat different, I suppose. The streets of Albi are amazing, sure, narrow and windy, typical southern architecture, very quaint, they however had nothing to do with what I felt as I saw the river for the first time.</p>
<p>    The bridges, the houses, the green, the mere attention to detail at every point you look was unfathomable; it felt like a fractal in that no matter how deep you looked, there was always another detail awaiting your eyes; everything so sharp, and not, so derelict, and not. The emotions evoked simply asked the question &quot;why?&quot;; why do people make such beautiful things? Why put in the effort? Why waste your time? Is it a waste of time? What is it? Why? As I was at the bridges end I noticed the corbels of a very small balcony made of bricks, comprised of absolutely too many bricks to even count, however small the corbels themselves were. I couldn't even being to comprehend what the person was thinking when creating such a beauteous monstrosity.</p>
<p>    Coming from a modern Malta, I've always been fascinated by people's passion, it's always seemed easier to create for function, but time and time again there are people who go above and beyond, pour passion into their work and induce awe. I cannot understand the mind of such a person, even though I would consider myself as such; I refuse to believe there are enough of these people, I'm not sure they'd even think to think of themselves as such. This introduces doubt, do these people truly think they're going the extra mile? I've been using the word passion thus far, however I'm doubting how accurate of a word that is. If not passion, what is it then? Great, another word to add to the list of wordless emotions.</p>
<p>    I do feel the past is more of a home to such people, might it be for the simple fact things were just done differently in the past, or rather is it because the past is a lot bigger than the present? Who knows, maybe the past was richer in passion, maybe it's something we've left behind with rapid development; we don't have the time and freedom to express ourselves in the ways we did in the past. Nowadays we're in too much of a rush to have fun doing things, too much of a rush to appreciate the little details, so why make them in the first place? I'm not even sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, what is bad anyway? When are people happier, now, in a present that's focused on advancing, or back then, a time I cannot even begin to describe, but supposedly a more passionate time? How different even is the present from the past? The past was home to more inequality than the present, but is there a significant causation between happiness and inequality? Was it worth it? I'm not even sure whether or not I should be using happiness as the basis of my morality.</p>
<p>    Maybe I'm completely wrong and nothing's changed, passion has just taken a new form, a fluid that changes as do the masses; manifesting differently in different times, in different places, in different people. Why do I feel the passion of a bygone time more than that of my own time then? I truly believe in the philosophy that memories age like fine wine, could it be the past takes after that?</p>
