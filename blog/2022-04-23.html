        <p><span class="lettrine">W</span>ell, as of late I've been wanting to start a more long term project to organise all my thoughts &amp; projects, and recently I've stumbled upon a bunch of personal websites (mostly consisting of blogs and development projects) which inspired me to make my own. The thing is, a website requires content, but what was I to upload? One of my first ideas was a blog, but what about? I noticed that I often go off on tangents and rants about unrelated topics, often including my friends and thought that a blog would be a great place to release these interesting *<em>insert an adjective I cannot think of</em>* adventures. Whence the birth of this blog! It may seem as though the site is solely comprised of this blog, but I assure you I have a lot more other things &amp; sub-sites if you will planned to be hosted on this domain!<br>

Here are some 世龙 approved photos of baby ducks, the second one being provided by Charlotte whilst I chose the first one, enjoy :)</p>
