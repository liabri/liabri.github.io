        <p><span class="lettrine">E</span>ster, which if you've read my previous post about designing a Solar System, is the sole habitable planet of the Basterous Solar System. This article is going to follow the process of creating the planet itself, certain properties such as radius, mass, gravity and such have already all been decided in the previous article; therefore this article will focus mostly on the placement of land masses, the science behind it and portraying them on a map.</p>

<p>    This is unsurprisingly quite difficult, especially if you'd like to make a sound tectonic plate system, which to my surprise and potentially yours, is far from the only way to design the crust of a planet.  Initially, I was just drawing what I thought looked cool, just some random shapes here and there with some oceans. This was going to serve as my first draft, and I will be basing everything on this. Yes, the most southern continent does look like France; was I in France when I drew that? Yes, I actually was on a train to Bordeaux. My absolute favourite continent in this initial draft is the complete one towards the south, with it's own Drake Passage separating it from the polar continent of the south; let's just say I have a bit of a soft spot for the antarctic pensinsula, which is justified by Brittany. </p>

<p>    A very big problem with this map is how badly it projects onto a globe, as you may know, projecting a map of a globe onto a 2D surface has always been an issue for humans in that there is <em>always</em> a form of compromise. Mercator's projection, for example, inflates the size of objects in that the further away from the equator they are, the larger they appear. As you can see on the left, the poles are completely malformed when converting this first draft to a globe. From now on, everything I make will therefore follow the equirectangular projection, as it is one of the simpler ones to <em>wrap</em> your head around when drawing continents. Also it seems to be a default in the world-building community, and I'm too much of a noob to contest it.</p>

<p>    As I started to work on my second draft, I noticed how hard it was to create interesting landmass shapes. I did two things in attempt to remedy this, firstly, I tried a world generator which was actually met with a lot of success, giving me very interesting island chains that I would not have been able to create otherwise. I placed these masses on a blank canvas in GIMP, just moving them around as I saw fit, roughly following what I initially set in my first draft as I was quite fond of the ocean placement. However, I could not fully rely on this as naturally I would need more tailored continents to fit my taste and idea of what the world would be. This leads me to the second thing I did, which was create big blobs of white landmasses roughly shaped as I'd like, and going to town with gimp brushes specifically made for coastlines making them more intricate and natural looking. This was a tough battle as I'd have to keep converting the equirectangular map to a globe using maptoglobe.com, so every change was a slow one; I have no idea why there isn't a good application that allows drawing on a globe yet. Anyways, the problem with this is that there's no tectonic history; I'd like to create somewhat believable plates, so now the next step is to start from scratch in hopes of coming to the conclusion that is the incomplete image below, more or less at least.</p>

<p>    To start off, we're going to completely forget the previous map as it would only hinder my progress. As I'm quite a masochist, I'll be creating a whole detailed tectonic history of the planet, science baby. Firstly, we must start with a supercontinent, break it apart, reassemble it into a new supercontinent, then break it again until we find a stage in it's development we like. This must all be done following the rules of tectonic movement that I won't be going into detail here as I'm not your geography teacher. We will however have to introduce a few concepts.</p>
<p>    Hotspots, locations at which form local volcanic features, often remaining stationary relative to the Mantle, Hawaii being a great example. As a rough guideline, we can consider them to appear either near the rifting center of the supercontinent, more or less on the otherside of the planet, or in areas of weakened crust such as that of the trailing edge back-arc basins; that is not to say they do not form anywhere else. There are expected to be less than 70 hotspots in all of Ester.</p>
<p>    Large igneous provinces, massive regions of flood basalts created by giant mantle plumes; Iceland is considered the best example still existing today, it is however nowhere near the same scale as once existed. There have only been a dozen or so in the past billion years of Earth's history, rendering them very rare. They are often found beneath the Ocean, and do not often contribute any notable land masses, they are however known to leave behind hotspots after they're gone.</p>
<p>    Failed Rifts, naturally before talking about <em>failed</em> rifts, I think it'd be helpful to learn what an actual rift even is...</p>
