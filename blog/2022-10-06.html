        <p><span class="lettrine">W</span>orld building, an infintely deep rabbit hole one may find themselves stuck in. Fortunately I have not delved too deep into it <em>yet</em>, however my future is looking bleek.</p>
<h2>Realism; To be, or not to be</h2>
<p><span class="lettrine">A</span> very tricky part of this whole project is deciding what degree of realism I desire, for obvious reasons it will never be <em>real</em> but it could at the least be made plausible from a more scientific point of view, and that's what I want to go for. I feel like I'd be cheating and wouldn't be able to appreciate a world which has no sound logic &amp; science baked into its existence.</p>
<h2>Basterous (Solar System)</h2>
<p><span class="lettrine">T</span>o begin I started working on the solar system, unsurprisingly starting with the sun, the system will be a single sun system, maybe I will implement a second sun which has a very very large orbit and its virtually non-existent.</p>
<h3>Marxl (Sun)</h3>
<p>7.92e+26</p>
<h3>Eriyas (Planet #4, ours.)</h3>
<p>Eriyas /xxxxxx/, probably the only habitable planet of the solar system 'XXXXXX' /xxxxxx/.</p>
<p>Now deciding where on this habitable zone to place the earth; I ended up putting it 1.43AU away from the sun, which is the closest possible distance considering the periapsis of the planets orbit; as I would not like to make a solar year too long, which will dictate the average temperatures, the length of a solar year and probably a billion other things I'm not actually aware of.</p>

<h4>Moon(s?)</h4>
<p>Well, now that the basis for the planet is more or less done it's time to decide on the moon·s. Apparently moons seem to influence quite a lot, not only are they used to tell the time using lunar calendars but also dictate the wind, tide, and probably a lot more things I'm not qualified to know.</p>
<p>I'd like to have more than 1 moon, I think from a cultural perspective it would also be a lot more interesting to have multiple moons to play with. Based on what some dude on reddit says, three moons is concievable and actually not too complicated, so I'll be going for that.</p>
<h5>Aetiola /aɪtioʊlɑ/</h5>
<p>The largest of the three moons, illuminating the night sky with a deep red colour.</p>
<h5>Persys /pɛɹsɪs/</h5>
<p>The smallest &amp; closest of the three moons, composed of <em>IRON?</em> giving it a dark appearance filling the days sky with a very constrasting object, light does not reflect particularly well off it making it disappear at night.</p>
<h5>Dioxst /daɪokst/</h5>
<p>The middle child, although smaller than Aetiola, is even further which makes it seem to be similar in size to Persys.</p>
<h4>Ring?</h4>
<p>Rings sometimes have big bursts of entries into earths atmosphere but burn up before hitting the ground, cool for culture imagine lots of things coming down to earth than vanishing before they hit.</p>
