						<li>English<p>My primary language (so to speak), I say primary because as I learnt in my sociolinguistique course of 2022, the concept of a native language is not much of a great one. I grew up primarily in this language, went to an English-speaking primary & secondary school, that is to say until the age of 15. It is the language I primarily use to communicate and consume media as of 2022-10-16. I am able to swap between two dialects of english (they are not too divergant from eachother), those two being the Maltese dialect and the Internationalised British dialect.</p></li>
						
						<li>Malti<p>This is a tricky one, I grew up only with certain this is just to continue writing a bit</p></li>
						
						<li>Français<p>French, the first language I consider myself to have learnt to fluency. I moved to France in 2021 to pursue my degree in linguistics. Originally wanting to study in Italy, however after meeting my roommate Navet, I was slowly exposed to so much French that I decided to take up the language and consequently move here.</p></li>
						
						<li>Italiano<p>*INSERT EXPRESSION REGARDING BANE/THING THATS ALWAYS THERE BUT NEVER MASTER*, italian; Naturally, having grown up in Malta, where roughly 50% of the population speaks Italian more or less fluently, I've been exposed to the language a lot, particularly through TV (thanks ma). It was the first language I started studying during my first gap year, it was thanks to Italian that I moved to France for a linguistics degree, really and truly I owe my present situation to Italian. Thanks for always being there for me Italian :)</p></li>

						<li>普通话<p>As I am writing this, I'm hoping for Mandarin to be the fourth language I reach fluency in. I was not initially interesting in Mandarin but rather Japanese, having spent my whole first year of university practicing Japanese (esepcially at the orthographic level). I met ShiLong in my first year of university, becoming close friends by the second year I decided to pick up Mandarin, and I am always amazed at what a large world there is on the otherside of this language barrier</p></li>
